Dreija
===

Bake-at-home website framework. Define your own routes and UI, and dreija will build
them into an isomorphic single-page app.

Routes use `react-router` and `redux`. Builds a server, a client bundle, and any
additional assets. The finished product can be deployed any way you choose, including in a docker container.
